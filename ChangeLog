    Removed the dependencies on CVMFS and ARLB, and made it work
    with the new pilot2 on work directory.
  * runpilot2-wrapper.sh
    Removed the dependencies of CVMFS and ALRB,
    The following functions are removed: 
        check_cvmfs, setup_alrb, setup_local, setup_shoal, 
  * pilots_starter.py
    Removed one option "-a" to pass to pilot2, otherwise the new pilot2
    will use that directory to create a new work directory.
